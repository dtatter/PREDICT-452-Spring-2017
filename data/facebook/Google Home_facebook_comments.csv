2017-05-17,"I got the home at Christmas thinking while it appeared to be lacking features of Echo, it will quickly surpass echo. I'm still waiting.....it's basically a speaker I can verbally control music with at this point. :/"
2017-05-17,And now the shopping list function is pretty much useless since they switched to Google Express from Keep
2017-05-17,Ummmm...need to get up to date. Keep no longer works with Home. Now there is a useless Google Express App that crashes all the time.

2017-05-07,"Price will then go way up...it is close to mastering voice recognition, just continue with more devices supported, bluetooth, adding and deleting from calendar.  Adding a display technically just opens up a new 'can of worms', so to speak, and it will only slow development and add unnecessary complexity to an already GREAT device!"

2017-05-10,"I've been considering switching to Google Home from Echo. However, they only allow lights to be assigned to one room at a time. Also, they don't seem to allow custom names for rooms. That's a deal breaker. 

But I'd never ever go with crApple."
2017-04-28,Love my Google home
2017-04-29,"Same here, have both and Googke Home is smarter. Just need the ablitity for more automated features.

2017-04-26,"Put it in a playlist and tell Google Home to ""Play playlist (whatever you named it) on Play Music.  I have multiple playlists setup in Google Play Music and it works perfectly."
2017-04-26,Richard Sigouin It is not working for me.  I have tried playlists as well.

2017-04-25,Skynet need to know what's going on in your home.
2017-04-25,I have both and find google home is smarter. Can answer more questions than Alexa. Knows my home location outside the usa put of the box. Music has more bass.
2017-04-25,"I bought a Google Home for home. I loved it so much, that I bought one for work. Truly enjoy them, and they are very useful!"
2017-04-26,how about neither one after 40 years in high tech I don't get it ? slaves to tech you will never keep up just go broke.

2017-04-20,Total waste of money

2017-04-21,Got it last week. I am in Europe and bought it in the US. No updates available here but still love it. I expect more features and also support in Europe in the future. So it is worth the money and will be better in time

2017-04-18,"A simple remedy to all these OK Google issues would be to allow the Google home owner to name their device. Hence one would have to say ""OK name"" to activate the artificially intelligent device.  This would also remedy what I see and I'm sure many others see as a negative of the device. If the Google Home can remember the owners name then surely it can remember it's own assigned name."
2017-04-16,When will a replacement cord be available for purchase? Right now our Google Home is a dust collecting paper weight.
2017-04-17,Buy another and return it with the defective cord if Google can't hook you up with a new one.
2017-04-17,"I've contacted them regarding this and so far messages have been ignored. It's actually not their fault as our cord fell victim to our vacuum. I just think it's ridiculous to pay $139  when I only need a new cord. If that's my only option, then we won't be buying any more of their products."

2017-03-11,When is Google home in Australia???
2017-03-11,"I live in New Zealand and have google home and love it. It has more bass than echo so music sounds better.

Dont need to worry when its  coming to Austraila  or UK, etc as it knows your location, weather, time, shops, etc from your home location, unlike echo which home locations are basically us based.

Google Home knows where you live and get weather forcasts, etc according to my location unlke echo

Only issues is News is only US based, but will read BBC news and will need a plug adaptor, other than that its great and works un any location in the world as it gets your location from your google account and may well do even through your wifi location.

Mine knows even where i live in New Zealand so handy to ask store location and services in my aera.

My advice get one it works allready from home location. Annie get one either through evay or Google store  i got mine through ebay. You will only need a plug adaptor as the power supply does 220-240v also."

2017-02-25,Nope not in this part of dallas yet :(
2017-02-25,It sounds like a router security issue because that means it isn't reaching the Internet . Try turning off all of your router firewalls and security and see if it will work then.
2017-02-25,Will try it tonight again
2017-02-25,Also make sure you don't have any crazy characters in your password or it can throw it off as well.
2017-02-25,I just don't get why it worked fine until 3 weeks ago lol. No firmware updates or anythinf
2017-02-25,Might have to do with an IP address refresh and it's not picking everything up correctly again.
2017-02-25,Shouldn't 2 factory resets take care of it? Didn't think of that though. Will try tonight
2017-02-21,That's apples motto...better late then never
2017-02-21,Yes but it will cost about 500 bucks.
2017-02-21,LOL!  I agree with Grant. It will do half of what Google and Android does and cost  3 times as much.

Now I learn that it won't read books to her -- even books from the Google Play store.  So far this is an expensive verbal clock and outdoor thermometer.  Ya gotta admire their chutzpah.

2016-11-30,"love my home! its perfect for my google play music library. You guys should really try to integrate the home features into new model cars. The okay or hey google commands within a car to give you navigation, play your music, swap your songs, tell you about your fuel and air pressure or save dates for your oil change, or even control locking your doors on a timer would be amazing. It would also cut down on people fooling with their phone if the google assistant was there to do everything all by voice. I am sure you would need a personal hotspot but most cars come with that anyways. I think you could also create a adapter for a car. That would be useful too. Cars have voice commands too but they have to press a button and they dont have the power of google search at their fingertips while driving"

If I use Ok Google on my phone to add something to my shopping list, it adds the item to a Keep note titled ""Shopping"" however if I use Google Home, them items gets added to a Keep note titled ""Google Assistant shopping list."" Also, Google Home cannot add an item to my calendar and if my phone and Google Home both hear my request, the phone tells me another device is taking care of the request but Google Home says it cannot.

2016-11-27,I have the Echo and just got Google. I can honestly say the Google is way better. Echo is cool however it can only Wikipedia information. So the information that you have access to is minimal compared to Google who not only uses Wikipedia but Google as well and other information sources. It's just a better investment for the money. And the speaker although not as big as echoes in my opinion has a way better quality. So I still like my Echo but I use it in the kitchen now for recipes / measurements and music. Google is in the living room for everyday use and I couldn't be happier.
