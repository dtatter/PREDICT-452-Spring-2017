nothing so far
it can't anwser even the simplest of questions
I bought my wife this for a Christmas present.¬†We are always¬†researching different¬†trivia and figured this would be a great way to get information quickly. I also assumed that since it was backed by Google¬†that it would have unlimited access to information. I was very wrong.¬†This cant even answer the simplest questions, but it will keep telling you that its "learning". I asked it to name the movies nominated for best picture¬†for this years Oscars and it couldn't answer that question. I asked what two teams are playing in the superbowl. again it could not answer the question. so far this is a¬†complete waste of money. we don't care about using it to turn on lights and things like that. we want questions answered.
one other thing that is disappointing is it has to be plugged in. You would think it would be portable enough to have a built in charger. we spend our summers by the pool and would love to take it to the back yare to use without having to plug it in. we'll hear a song and want to know the name and artist. it would be great to do that. but it probably wouldn't be able to answer the question anyway.¬†

Saying "You suck!" lets you submit complaint
It is a very sub-standard product
They went through all the hoops to get Chromecast on it but don't support pairing as a bluetooth speaker and microphone? ¬†That is a big fail. ¬†Also, Pandora constantly freezes, requiring a reboot. ¬†When it is not freezing, it is skipping ahead automatically a few seconds into the song. ¬†Just long enough for you to think: "Hey! Great song! ... Oh, damn!" ¬†Also, I am a paid Pandora subscriber with no other people or devices accessing my account, yet I frequently hear: "You are currently using more than one device". ¬†No I am not. ¬†Also, the voice recognition is crap. ¬†God help you if you want to listen to "The Byrds" or "Beck". ¬†"I'm sorry, I can't help you with that." ¬†The one thing I like about it so far, is that when you say: "Hey Google, you suck!" it lets you submit a complaint.

I love the audio quality and accuracy of some answers.
I don't like the lack of calendar sync and inaccurate alert times.
I am very impressed with the audio quality of the Google Home but disappointed that it meant only for a Chromecast speaker and not Bluetooth speaker as well because I like to listen to Police Scanner 5-0 app which is not a Chromecast yet. It would be great on Home or Chromecast Ultra. I also have been disappointed with the Chromecast listed apps that suddenly won't Chromecast Christian stations or Jewish either but have no issue with Muslim radio. I am particularly sad that Bott Radio Network won't Chromecast but I have a great Blackweb Tsunami Bluetooth speaker I named Blackie and I paired with Dottie, my Amazon Echo Dot 2nd Generation companion. If the Home would become Bluetooth connectivity I would sell the Amazon Echo Dot 2nd Generation and Blackweb Tsunami Bluetooth speaker to get the space on my surge suppressor for the Home again which my housemate loves for verbal music and information obtaining.

easy set-up
doesn't do much
it doesn't recognize multiple users either which for the price is expected - to know the voices of the family.

Google name
lots of hiccups
Early adopter so I knew this would not be perfect yet but have high hopes. Does not have the same capabilities as Amazon Echo and is lacking in many areas. Synced it with my Hue lights and Smartthings devices. The hiccups came when I asked it to turn off the lights and only some went off and others stayed on. It took me several tries to get this to work. Music is okay, sync with Pandora or Google Music but again hiccups come when you ask to play songs by certain artists and instead it plays from a station not even related to that artist. I have no doubts this will improve but I ask myself a few times why don't I return and wait for this to get better. Jury is still out on this device.

Its beautiful and speakers are really nice
129$ price. It should have been 99$ :)
Have been using it for 10 days. I also have echo. Though Echo works most of the time, Google Home speaker quality is way better for music. I have stopped using my Bose bluetooth speakers, thats saying something. Home is also better looking (customizable though have default option with me) and has better answers. Best of the lot is 'Play Trivia' feature on Google Home!! My kids love that along with knock knock jokes. Though diff may not be much but I think Google Home listens and interprets better.¬†
I will not allow Skynet aka Google in my home to monitor my data activities I pass on echo tooEllen Murphy, soon she can do German :)Hern√°n RosarioLo vi en el google io te invito a que lo veas , estuvo buenoStill waiting on previous updates here in CanadaWhen?https://youtu.be/upZ0jWV5mzg [[VIDEO_SHARE_YOUTUBE]]I just want it to cast sound from Netflix-be the surround sound for the movie I'm watching ...ughhhhh something so simplehttps://youtu.be/upZ0jWV5mzg [[VIDEO_SHARE_YOUTUBE]]Not working for me (I'm in Norway)Not happy [[PHOTO]]Ralph Bowlin Jeff Fisher [[PHOTO]]Should it finally get one of the most "Expected" and "Common sense" features that it should have had all along? ....Errr....yes.How it didn't have reminders, events and notes is beyond me lolAre they ever gonna get it to work with Sonos like Alexa can?How much? üòçüòçAbout 600.00What features?

I don't Apple! Google Home is greatI've been considering switching to Google Home from Echo. However, they only allow lights to be assigned to one room at a time. Also, they don't seem to allow custom names for rooms. That's a deal breaker. 

But I'd never ever go with crApple.Love my Google homeSame here, have both and Googke Home is smarter. Just need the ablitity for more automated features.

Are you talking about playing your own music?From a playlist on your phone.Music that I have uploaded to Google Play Music is not recognized by Google Home.Put it in a playlist and tell Google Home to "Play playlist (whatever you named it) on Play Music.

Got to love hands free, especially when your hands are busy with little ones!Still don't have the option even though I have the last update.Mike Bailey [[PHOTO]]My Google home still talks to my husband and I as the same person lolPaoloA simple remedy to all these OK Google issues would be to allow the Google home owner to name their device. Hence one would have to say "OK name" to activate the artificially intelligent device.  This would also remedy what I see and I'm sure many others see as a negative of the device. If the Google Home can remember the owners name then surely it can remember it's own assigned name.When will a replacement cord be available for purchase? Right now our Google Home is a dust collecting paper weight.Buy another and return it with the defective cord if Google can't hook you up with a new one.I've contacted them regarding this and so far messages have been ignored. It's actually not their fault as our cord fell victim to our vacuum. I just think it's ridiculous to pay $139  when I only need a new cord. If that's my only option, then we won't be buying any more of their products.When can it do this ?Mallory DayleyVarun VakhariaAshleeI love my google home the money was definitely worth itRogerio SuguimotoI, for one, would have found it highly entertaining. üòÇI want Google Home.

Dont need to worry when its  coming to Austraila  or UK, etc as it knows your location, weather, time, shops, etc from your home location, unlike echo which home locations are basically us based.

Google Home knows where you live and get weather forcasts, etc according to my location unlke echo

Only issues is News is only US based, but will read BBC news and will need a plug adaptor, other than that its great and works un any location in the world as it gets your location from your google account and may well do even through your wifi location.

Mine knows even where i live in New Zealand so handy to ask store location and services in my aera.

My advice get one it works allready from home location. Annie get one either through evay or Google store  i got mine through ebay.

I also had to PAY more than the damn thing is even selling for and what I even paid for it. What if I didn't have the money to "pay" you for another one? I realize that once I send back the defective one I'll be "reimbursed" but this is not fair. This isn't a way to treat your customers.

The okay or hey google commands within a car to give you navigation, play your music, swap your songs, tell you about your fuel and air pressure or save dates for your oil change, or even control locking your doors on a timer would be amazing. It would also cut down on people fooling with their phone if the google assistant was there to do everything all by voice. I am sure you would need a personal hotspot but most cars come with that anyways. I think you could also create a adapter for a car. That would be useful too.

I do find it odd that Google Assistant on the Google Home Device and my Nexus 6 phone don't play very well together. For example. If I use Ok Google on my phone to add something to my shopping list, it adds the item to a Keep note titled "Shopping" however if I use Google Home, them items gets added to a Keep note titled "Google Assistant shopping list." Also, Google Home cannot add an item to my calendar and if my phone and Google Home both hear my request, the phone tells me another device is taking care of the request but Google Home says it cannot. I realize the device is new and I am overall very happy with my purchase.Kuzak ParkTeK ParkI currently have one and I love it a lot. I just wish it were wireless instead of having it plugged in. Works magic with the Hue lights.So should I buy one or wait for Jibo?looks like a air freshenerSomething Google need to do is making the assistant visible and fun to integrate with, give it a nice hologram character and personalities to choose from. Like this: https://youtu.be/nkcKaNqfykg
That is a winning concept for this technology
#google are you listening?I accidentally stumbled on a cool trick... Say "hey Google, launch Eliza" and have a convo with your Google home :)Love Netflix control with the Chromecast..   
A bit of a hack you can get Google home to pause, fast-forward and rewind Hulu... HBOGO etc
First you have to use your phone or tablet to stream Hulu and other to Chromecast.... Next episode also has to be done by device rather the voice to Google homeI have four Google Homes and love them, I enjoy playing the same song throughout the house. I can't wait for more integration, and for them to get ahead of Amazon Echo. I just bought a Harmony Elite remote and I can't wait for full integration!I wonder how it compares to Alexa from Amazon....Hey Cesar! I have one Amazon Echo and four Google Homes. Google Home all day for me, but it is personal preference. I give Google Home 6 months, and I think it will do way more. I like that they sync throughout the the home, also you can keep asking questions about a particular subject. On the Amazon you can't keep asking questions with the same subject. 

Check out this video and it might help. I have a lot of gadgets and phones with the Google ecosystem. It's an easy choice for me.  https://youtu.be/SL-sPG6wgOUI watch a lot of YouTube videos, and I am enjoying Redtube for 6 months for free. You get no commercials and free music.Niels Hoogkamer, do I want this? ü§ìWhat's the deal Google? All of a sudden you're not streaming music?? #strangeI don't see that there is such a mailing list. In regard to current features and commands, we will be publishing a list soon.From what I have seen so far, no. But I hope they do. It would be nice for Google to recognize who were are and check individual calendars and interact with us individually.Best buySo Google just replaced the Chromcast app with the Google Home app which doesn't work with the Chromcast device. So it's up to me the consumer to buy the new Chromcast ultra for $69.99. I'm just asking a lawyer I can sue Google for this.I have the regular Chromecast on my TV and the Google Home had no issues playing YouTube videos on my TV with my voice commands.Good for youPrasad Raikar :)NiceWe asked our new google home and Alexa who would win the presidential election.

Thank youSi jetai plein de cash a d√©pens√© Caroline NicolIvett PereyraRight  nowOutside of buying the Google Home, is there anything else I would need to purchase, or that is required for Google Home to work?Lori DiSantii, you will also need to install the Google Home app on your Android or iOS device.I have the Echo and just got Google. I can honestly say the Google is way better. Echo is cool however it can only Wikipedia information. So the information that you have access to is minimal compared to Google who not only uses Wikipedia but Google as well and other information sources. It's just a better investment for the money. And the speaker although not as big as echoes in my opinion has a way better quality. So I still like my Echo but I use it in the kitchen now for recipes / measurements and music. Google is in the living room for everyday use and I couldn't be happier.Amazon Echo V Google Home   http://www.iotroadmap.com/amazon-echo-v-google-home/Kenneth Smalls take the old speaker back asap and watch this vidoeCraig Dice ChretienMike HicksChris Weston quite a nice summary of what it can do!and this is just the start!!!I have Amazon Echo, and Google Home already.
